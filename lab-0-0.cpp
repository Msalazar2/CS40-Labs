1. Compilers detect syntax errors.
2. Usually the most difficult errors to correct are the logic errors,
since they are not detected in the compilation process.
3. Attaching other pre-written routines to your program is done by the linking
process.
4. Binary code is the machine code consisting of ones and zeroes
that is read by the computer.
5. Dividing by zero is an example of a run time error.
